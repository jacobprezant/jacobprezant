### Hey, I'm Jacob. 
I'm a high school student in NYC, and I write iOS for OSS.

Take a look at my most recent project, [Plethora](https://github.com/jacobprezant/Plethora); an iOS proof-of-concept, written entirely in Swift, for developers seeking to implement data extraction and modification within `.mobileprovision` profiles and `.ipa` packages.

Or,
take a look at my most recent vulnerability writeup [here](https://gist.github.com/jacobprezant/a81dcf157dde880a1879fb72854651a0), on the limitations of `userDidTakeScreenshotNotification`.
